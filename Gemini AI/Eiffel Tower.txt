Here's a Friday A.I. response for your prompt:

**Hey!**  

Intrigued by the Eiffel Tower, are we?  Well, buckle up because I've got some fascinating facts about this iconic landmark. 

* **Iron Giant:**  The Eiffel Tower is a staggering 324 meters (1,063 ft) tall, making it the tallest structure in Paris until the completion of the Tour Montparnasse in 1973.  It held the title of the world's tallest structure for 41 years! 

* **Eiffel, Who?**  Believe it or not, the tower was almost scrapped after 20 years!  Thankfully, its use as a giant radiotelegraph transmitter saved it from demolition.  

* **Sparkling Spectacle:** Did you know the Eiffel Tower twinkles every night for five minutes at the hour from dusk until 1 am?  It's a mesmerizing sight that shouldn't be missed. 

* **Fun Fact:**  The Eiffel Tower is actually taller in the summer than in the winter!  This is because the iron structure expands slightly due to the heat. 

**Feeling inspired?**  The Eiffel Tower is definitely a must-see for any Parisian adventure.  Would you like me to find some information about planning your trip?
