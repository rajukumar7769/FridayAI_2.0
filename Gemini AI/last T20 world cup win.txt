Friday A.I. response for Prompt: Friday tell me about last T20 world cup win 
 *************************

Absolutely! Let's see here. To refresh your memory, the last T20 World Cup win goes to the  **Australia National Cricket Team**. They clinched the championship title in the 2021 edition of the tournament which was held in the United Arab Emirates. 

Is there anything specific you'd like to know about their win, like the opponent in the finals or some key moments of the match?
