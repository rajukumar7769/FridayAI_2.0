Friday A.I. response for Prompt: using AI tell me about Gandhi 
 *************************

(In a gentle, calming voice)

Ah, Mahatma Gandhi. A titan of peace and justice.  Here's what I can tell you about him on this fine Friday morning:

* **Champion of Non-Violence:**  Gandhi led India's independence movement through Satyagraha, a philosophy of non-violent resistance. He believed in truth, justice, and peaceful protest.

* **Advocate for Equality:**  He fought against racial discrimination in South Africa and social inequality in India, particularly the caste system. 

* **Simple Living:**  Gandhi championed a simple life, living modestly and wearing homespun cloth. This symbolized self-reliance and detachment from materialism.

* **Inspiration for the World:**  His message of peace and non-violent resistance continues to inspire movements for social change around the globe.

Is there anything specific you'd like to know about Gandhi's life or legacy?  I'm happy to share more.
